PCRedux has been developed publicly by a group of qPCR entusiasts since 2017. 
But the foundations were created much earlier. These are the qpcR package [1], 
the MBmca package [2] and the chipPCR package [3]. PCRedux has been available on 
CRAN since 2017-11-2. However, it was archived on 2020-12-16 due to a dependency 
on the chipPCR package. The chipPCR package was removed as the developer email 
address no longer existed. The chipPCR package is now available on CRAN again. 
Since 2017, the PCRedux package has been constantly evolving and few features 
have been introduced in 2020. Since then the package has been considered stable. 
This publication has been used to make corrections and to improve the technical 
basis of the package.
